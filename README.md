## ðŸ“– Documentation

The `injective-dex` is built using Nuxt and TailwindCSS and its powered by the [injective-ts monorepo](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/injective-ts/).

You can always boot the dex locally on your own laptop without having to set up a relayer. You can use the `public` network in your `APP_NETWORK` `.env` configuration variable and run the `yarn run dev` command. You can find all of the available networks (i.e - predefined set of endpoints) [here](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/injective-ts/blob/17b1aa5df39d5724baf6262b276980cf722a1cba/packages/networks/src/types.ts#L1). Using these endpoints (from the `public`) network gives the 40% of the trading fees to the community spend pool.

### Deployment

The `injective-dex` uses AWS for deployment. There is a CD pipeline set in the `.github/workflow/deploy.yml` file. Deployment to AWS is done to a S3 bucket which is served through Cloudfront to the end user. Using `nuxt build && nuxt generate` we are generating static html pages that are served through cloud front.

The `injective-dex` can also be served as a SPA. To do this, you have to have a node server running and serve the `dist` folder that gets generated when you do the `yarn build` command.

More details about how to deploy a Nuxt project can be found on their docs.
